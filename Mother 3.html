                  <strong>Summary</strong> 
                  <div>
                    <p> Mother 3 is third and final installment in the Mother series. It was supposed to be release on the <strong>Nintendo 64</strong>
                        but ended up on the <strong>Game Boy Advanced</strong> and released on April 20th, 2006. Mother 3 was a success when released selling 
                        200,000 copies within the first week of release. It was only released in japan and never got to be played globally but there has been 
                        many fan translations for the game. It was also released on the <strong>Wii U</strong> but yet again only in japan.</p>

                        <p> Mother 3 has a really great story that I think everyone you have the chance to play and it's also full of spoliers so i'll be shortly summarizing 
                            what story is about without any spoliers. Mother 3 is about a boy named <strong>Lucas</strong> who with him and his friends have save Nowhere island
                            from Porky and his arm. The takes place many years after <strong>Eartbound or Mother 2</strong> and under the island resides a dragon who has been put to
                            sleep by the acestors of the <strong>Magypsies</strong> who are a tribe that protect the <strong>Seven Needles</strong>. The <strong>Seven Needles</strong>
                            are the things that keep the dragon sealed. Once they are pulled out depending on the persons heart the dragon will either destroy the world or make peace with the 
                            people. Lucas and Porky are at race to see who can pull the needle first and control what the dragon actions are. And that's the main plot of the game, now lets talk
                            about the gameplay.</p>
                            <div>

                            Mother 3 still retains the basic <strong>RPG</strong> format just like the other games in the series. Just like <strong>Earthbound</strong> Mother 3 has the <strog>PSI</strog> system as well
                            were Lucas and other characters can use healing and attack moves. Some other small changes were made like you can actual run which hasn't been in placed since the first game and now bosses also
                            have <strong>PSI</strong> abillites which forces the player to use more strategy un like in previous game where Jeffs rockets would one shot bossess. Graphics are nice and colourfull better than 
                            the last game and for the first time the main character <strong>Lucas</strong> actually talks which makes him the only protagonist in to be able to in the franchise. The game made one last change which
                            was adding chapters to build up story. In each chapter you get to play as different characters who have different stories from Lucas and you can use these characters in fight's as well. Overrall Mother 3
                            is one of the best video games of all time along with a story and soundtrack that makes the game more enjoyable and fun to play throught.
