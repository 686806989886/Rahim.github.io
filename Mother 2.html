                The image above is a picture of Nintendos advertsing for the game in US. Many fans blame the games low selling because of the lack luster advertising from Nintendo 
                which didn't give the game the recognition it deserved.</p>

                    <strong>Gameplay/story</strong>  
                   <p>Earthbound took around 5 years to make with there being many plans to cancel production. But thanks to the development from <strong>APE inc</strong> Earthbound was able to release and it looked way better than the first installment.
                    The story is about a boy named Ness who wakes up to a metoer crashing near by his house. He and his neighbor Porky go check it out and end up talk to a bug named Buzz Buzz who is from the future.
                    He warns Ness about the evil threat named Gigas whose corrubting animals and humans in hope of taking over the world. Ness must travel all over Eagleland to find the other chosen heroes and collect the eight magical melodies to neatrailze Gigas.
                    With that Ness goes out to find the remaining heroes and get all eight melodies starting from his house in Onett the city he's from. The other heroes in the order you meet them are Paula, Jeff and Poo. After finding the magical melodies you fight Gigas 
                    who has traveled back in time in order to avoid the heroes which makes the heroes also have to go back in time to defeat him. After beating Gigas Ness and the others will head back to the future and live out the rest of their lives. But it seems that porky who was
                    with Gigas has seemed to be tranported to a different time period which makes the player question what happend to him.</p>

                    <p> Earthbound is a RPG which means <strong>role-playing game</strong> and it's because of this that the game play is different from other games published by Nintendo.
                        The battles are turned based meaning you have to choice what you'll do in a turned based system. Will you attack, will you use <strong>PSI</strong> a magical type 
                        attack that deals a massive amount of damage in return for your <Strong>PSI energy</Strong> or will you just block the enemies attack. This is why gamers like games 
                        like Earthbound because there are so many ways and tactics to beat enemies and progress throught the story. Ness can use both attacks and PSI abillites while Paula 
                        can use more powerful PSI abillites and all so heal the party. Jeff can use his inventions to lauch at enemies and even one shot bosses with Bottle Rockets and Poo 
                        can use the most powerful PSI abillite PS Starstorm. </p>
