               The franchise didn't get international recognition till 1994 with the release of <strong>Earthbound</strong> which was called <strong>Mother 2</strong> in Japan and released for the SNES <strong>(Super Nintendo Entertainment System)</strong>. The person you play as is a young boy named <strong>Ness</strong> who has to save the world from the alien Giygas and to do so you have to recruit power allies to help you with this mission.
               The second installment was a major success in Japan but the US not so much, only selling 72.000 copies.With these stats in mind Shigesato started to get to work and make the last Mother game <strong>Mother 3.</strong> </p>

               <strong>Mother 3</strong> is the final game in the Mother franchise with it being released on April 20th 2006 for the Game Boy Advance. Like all Mother games it's a role-playing where you play as a child named <strong>Lucas</strong> who has to stop the destruction of the world from the evil being named Proky. What makes this game different from the other Mother games is that it never released outside japan. Many fans have tried to figure out why the game was never released but most came to the conclusion it's because of the games content
               <strong>Mother3</strong> has very surious topics in the game that Nintendo thought would be to surious for a global audience which is why the game was never released outside of japan.</p>
