            <p><strong>Mother</strong> or called <strong>Earthbound beginnings</strong> is the first game of the Mother series.
                The whole Idea came togther when Shigesato Itoi wanted to make a game based on his favourite genre role-playing games.
                He went to get his idea aproved by Nintendo and asked the creator of mario Shigeru Miyamoto to review his idea.
                He was rejected but after editing the script was able to get his game released.
                Selling 400k copies in Japan it was a real hit but it release globally till years later.</p>

             <p>The technology way back when the game was released way cheaper and slower than we have now making this game very annoying for people
                that like high preforming games. Next the actually game is very hard to beat due to random encounters and strenght of enemies.
                Mother also gives the player no map so they don't know where their going which leads to them dying to random encounters because of the encounter rate
                which is too high. This is why people don't play the first game as much compaired to Mother 2 and Mother 3.</p>
